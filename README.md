The assignment:

Prlwytzkofsky College provides courses in a variety of subjects. In order to help the students with the material, the college wants to create a system that would offer formative 
tests, hereafter called quizzes.Students who take a course must eventually successfully complete all the tests in that course once, in order to show that they have 
mastered the material. The testing system contains a database with a number of questions for each quiz. These questions are presented to the students via a desktop application.
Each quiz has a success definition: the minimum number of questions the student must have answered correctly. 
Of course, the success definition must be lower than the number of questions in the quiz.
